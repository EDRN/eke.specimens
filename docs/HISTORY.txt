=========

What follows is a history of changes from release to release.  Within each
description, you can find more details about cited issue numbers by visiting
the issue tracker at https://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CA


1.0.0 - Plone 4
---------------

This release makes eke.specimens compatible with Plone 4.


0.0.3 - NYU
-----------

This release tackles the following:

* If an ERNE site is down and the ERNE cache returns an HTTP 500 error, don't
  abort the entire ingest.  Just skip that site and go forward.  "Keep calm
  and carry on."


0.0.2 - A Mixed Bag
-------------------

This release addresses the following issue:

* CA-698 - "Structural" objects appear in searches


0.0.1 - Goodbye, Peter Lin
--------------------------

This time around, the EKE specimen package provides direct display of ERNE
specimen data without having to delegate to the ERNE UI web application.
(There is no corresponding issue in the issue tracker for this new feature; or
if there is, the issue tracker is down as I write this and can't confirm.)

This release also addresses the following issues:

* CA-683 - Counts are off on specimen search
* CA-685 - Specimen Tab search results returns records for the same search
  summary more than one time (should be grouped together)

0.0.0 - Unreleased
------------------

Initial release into beta.
